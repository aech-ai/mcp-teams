# Agent Aech: Modular IR Architecture and Reasoning Primer

This document is a comprehensive, detailed record of a technical conversation about designing a modular, future-proof Information Retrieval (IR) backend for Agent Aech—a domain-integrated agent operating via MCP (Model Context Protocol) with access to M365 (Teams, OneDrive, Email, etc.) and extensible to any business workflow. The goal is to provide a reasoning LLM with a rich, structured context for proposing novel architectures and solutions.

## 1. Problem Statement & Vision

- **Agent Aech** is an autonomous agent with its own mailbox, OneDrive, Teams, and more, operating as a first-class user in an M365 domain.
- The goal is to enable Agent Aech to automate any business workflow via MCP-enabled apps, with IR as a core capability.
- Data sources are varied (PDF, Word, Excel, email, chat, etc.), and the IR backend must be:
  - **Flexible** (easy to add new sources, chunking strategies, search modes)
  - **Powerful** (hybrid search, LLM reranking, RAG, etc.)
  - **Low-maintenance** (easy to operate, update, and extend)
  - **Composable** (MCP tools/resources for LLMs and agentic clients)

## 2. Modular MCP Server for FlockMTL & DuckDB: Architecture & Benefits

### 2.1. Motivation
- **Reusability**: Plug-and-play IR backend for any MCP-enabled app
- **Separation of Concerns**: Core IR logic decoupled from domain adapters (Teams, Email, etc.)
- **Scalability**: Dedicated resources, centralized optimization, resource pooling
- **LLM Integration**: Direct tool access, unified data interface, RAG pipeline standardization

### 2.2. Layered Architecture

```

- **Core Layer**: DuckDB, FlockMTL, vector/embedding, storage
- **Extension Layer**: Search, LLM connectors, resource management
- **Adapter Layer**: Teams, Email, Document adapters; schema transformers

### 2.3. MCP Interface
- **Resources**: tables, models, prompts, indexes
- **Tools**: execute_sql, create_table, search, hybrid_search, semantic_search, keyword_search, llm_rerank, llm_summarize, llm_generate

### 2.4. Handling Domain-Specific Logic
- **Adapter Pattern**: Map domain objects to generic schema
- **Schema Abstraction**: Use abstract tables with metadata for platform-specific fields
- **Plugin Architecture**: Register adapters/plugins for each domain

### 2.5. Code Management
- **Dedicated repo** with clear layering (core, extensions, adapters, mcp, tests, docs)
- **Integration**: Python package, Docker, Git submodule
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning, Git tags
- **Adapter management**: Monorepo or separate repos
- **Dependency management**: Core vs. optional deps
- **Extending**: Documented process for new adapters

## 3. DuckDB vs. PostgreSQL for IR

### 3.1. DuckDB
- **Embedded, serverless, zero-config**
- **Columnar, analytics-optimized** (OLAP, vectorized execution)
- **Modern SQL, easy extension loading**
- **Tight Python/data science integration**
- **Single-file, portable, low-maintenance**

### 3.2. PostgreSQL
- **Enterprise-grade, multi-user, networked**
- **ACID, robust, scalable, secure**
- **Rich extension ecosystem** (pgvector, pg_trgm, PostGIS)
- **Advanced features** (materialized views, partitioning, triggers)
- **Best for production, multi-user, transactional workloads**

### 3.3. Summary Table
| Feature         | DuckDB                | PostgreSQL           |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Deployment      | Embedded, serverless  | Networked, multiuser |
| Analytics       | Excellent             | Good                 |
| OLTP            | Not ideal             | Excellent            |
| Extensions      | Growing               | Mature               |
| Maintenance     | Low                   | Higher               |
| Python/DS       | Excellent             | Good                 |

## 4. Chunking Strategies for Document IR

### 4.1. Why Chunk?
- LLMs and vector search have context limits; long docs must be split
- Goal: maximize IR quality by chunking at optimal boundaries

### 4.2. Strategies
- **Fixed-size** (tokens/words/characters, with/without overlap)
- **Semantic/paragraph-based** (split at natural boundaries)
- **Hybrid** (merge small paragraphs, split large ones)
- **Sliding window** (overlapping chunks)
- **Content-aware** (special handling for code, tables, etc.)

### 4.3. Workflow
1. Extract text (PDF, Word, etc.)
2. Chunk using best-fit strategy
3. Store each chunk as a row in DuckDB/Postgres (with metadata)
4. Embed and index (BM25, vector, hybrid)
5. Retrieve and rerank at query time

### 4.4. Optimization
- Tune chunk size/overlap for best recall/precision
- Store rich metadata for filtering/context expansion
- Experiment and compare strategies in SQL

---

## 5. Automation & State of the Art

- **Most chunking/embedding/indexing is still semi-manual** (Python scripts, pipelines)
- **TimescaleDB**: [Auto chunk size recommendations](https://medium.com/timescale/boost-your-postgresql-performance-with-auto-chunk-size-recommendations-f407406174e0) (infra-level, not semantic)
- **Frameworks**: LlamaIndex, LangChain, Haystack automate pipelines, often using Postgres as backend
- **No end-to-end semantic chunking automation in Postgres yet**
- **Emerging trend**: Managed platforms and cloud DBs are starting to automate more of the IR pipeline

---

## 6. Ideal IR Backend for Agent Aech

- **Modular, pluggable IR backend** (Postgres or DuckDB + FlockMTL)
- **Automated ingestion/chunking layer** (detects type, applies best strategy, embeds, stores, indexes)
- **MCP-enabled API layer** (all IR/search as MCP tools/resources)
- **Continuous improvement** (monitor, re-chunk, re-embed as models/strategies improve)
- **Abstract IR layer** (don't tie business logic to a specific DB or chunker)
- **Composable pipelines** (modular, swappable components)
- **Open standards** (for embeddings, metadata, chunk storage)
- **Monitor ecosystem** (swap in new models/chunkers as they emerge)

---

## 9. Open Questions for Reasoning LLM

- How can chunking and embedding be made fully adaptive and content-aware, with minimal human tuning?
- What is the best way to automate the ingestion and IR pipeline for new data sources (e.g., OneDrive, SharePoint, email) in a modular MCP architecture?
- How can the IR backend be made "self-improving" (e.g., feedback loops, auto-rechunking, auto-reembedding)?
- What is the optimal way to expose IR/search capabilities to LLMs and agentic clients via MCP?
- How can we future-proof the architecture to quickly adopt new LLMs, chunkers, and search paradigms as they emerge?
- What are the best practices for observability, security, and cost management in such a modular, multi-adapter IR backend?
